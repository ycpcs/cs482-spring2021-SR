Due: [See the Assignments page for due dates](../assign/index.html)

# Your Task

In this assignment you will propose the project you or your group will work on for the semester.  You will also set up a repository and issue tracker, and document the requirements you plan to address for [Milestone 1](assign03.html).

# Deliverables

There are three deliverables.

## Proposal description

Using Google Docs, write a 4-5 page proposal describing your project.  Describe what problem it is intended to solve, who the users are, what languages/frameworks/technologies you plan to use, etc.  Use diagrams as appropriate (e.g., user interface sketches, block diagrams, DB schemas, UML, etc.)

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: It is **imperative that you consult with your Engineering Capstone team** to discuss tasks and priorities before you write the proposal.
</div>

## Repository and issue tracker

Update your project repository (e.g., on [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)) and your issue tracker.  In your proposal document, include a link to the repository.

## Requirements for Milestone 1

Update your issue tracker to document the requirements that you plan to address in [Milestone 1](assign03.html).  Each requirement should be a single issue, written in the form of a user story or use case, with a reasonable amount of detail.  In your issue tracker, create a milestone for Milestone 1 and associate your issues with it.  (Both Github's and Bitbucket's issue trackers support milestones.)

# Submitting

Share your proposal document with both instructors (<djhake2@ycp.edu> and <dbabcock@ycp.edu>), granting editing permission.
